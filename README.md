### Intorduction

**ABC-BRANN** is a time-series estimating approach for predicting the flammable cloud volumes and dimensions in a congested offshore setting. This approach is composed of the Artificial bee colony optimization algorithm (ABC) and the Bayesian Regularization Artificial Neural Network (BRANN) to construct a hybird algorithm. By the former optimizes the neural network weight parameters to improve the prediction accuracy of flammable cloud difffusion.
